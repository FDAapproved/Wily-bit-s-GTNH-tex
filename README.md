WIP

Meant to be a redoing of GNTH textures
HIGHLY RECOMMEND ADDING THE [TEXTUREPACK MODERNITY](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/modernity), (put it lower on the texturepack list than this pack)

Currently all electronic components up to HV have been done
Some machines have faces, (planned to be all of them)
Doesn't change only GT mods textures
